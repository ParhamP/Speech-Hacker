Speech-Hacker (New Release)
===========================
Would you like to make any famous figure speak whatever you want? Use
Speech-Hacker to train your own speaker and receive speeches spoken by
them.

Description
-----------

Speech-Hacker takes a large data base of audio speeches spoken by your
chosen figure and employs Simple Audio Indexer (Using Watson Speech API)
to split them on words and to create smaller chunks of audio files
containing those words. Finally, your desired speech's words and phrases
get associated with audio chunks that were created and converted, so
that you can receive a brand new speech spoken by your figure.

Significant Improvement in New Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In earlier versions, Speech-Hacker was using pydub to split words based
on amount of silence between them. That worked, but it wasn't as smart
as we wanted to be. Therefore, we thought of using IBM Watson Speech API
to index words. Of course, we got much better results!
SimpleAudioIndexer was built as a separate project to help us implement
this functionality for Speech-hacker.
